## About

### Desktop utiltiies that you'll need
Tired of using notepad to jot down notes? Don't like your cluttered desktop? Want to get rid of those unpleasant shortcuts? Core has got you covered.
### Easy configuration
With a dedicated configuration menu for each skin, Core makes customization easier for new users without the user having to modify the code or write some of their own.
### Update checker
Core's built-in update checker will make sure you never miss out on new features or bug fixes. Core can also notify you whenever there are new updates for the skins you have installed. You can install all the updates via a single button press and Core takes care of the rest for you.
